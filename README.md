# Brute-Force-Attack
This program decrypts hashes and uses a brute force attack methodology to break through access controlled levels with passwords.
## Installaton
Install python and import the different modules
```bash
import random
```
```bash
import haslib
```
```bash
import string
```
```bash
import csv
```
## Functionalities 
Objective 1: User Input (Achieved)
For this task you are required to accept a user input and store it appropriately to be used in the
decryption function. It will be expected that the user can insert either a single hash, or multiple hashes
via the command line.
Objective 2: File Input (In-progress)
For this task you will be asked to read a supplied CSV file that will consist of SHA256 hashes. The
file may consist of a single hash, or multiple hashes, and it will be expected that these are stored
appropriately.
CSV File
Objective 3: Brute Forcing the Hash (Partially Achieved)
For this task, you are expected to take the collection of hashes (either user-inserted, or from a file)
and decrypt them.
Each step in the decryption method should be shown in the command line, with the final output of the
proposed password and the total amount of time taken for the decryption process.
